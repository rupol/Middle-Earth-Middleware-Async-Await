# Middle Earth Middleware Backend

### Getting Started

- Clone this repo and run `npm install`
- Run `npm run server` and direct requests to `http://localhost:4000`
- Optional: you can select your host and port using environment variables

### User Endpoints

| Endpoints                                                        | Request          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| https://middleearth-middleware.herokuapp.com/api/users           | GET, POST        |
| https://middleearth-middleware.herokuapp.com/api/users/:id       | GET, PUT, DELETE |
| https://middleearth-middleware.herokuapp.com/api/users/:id/posts | GET, POST        |

### Post Endpoints

| Endpoints                                                  | Request          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| https://middleearth-middleware.herokuapp.com/api/posts     | GET              |
| https://middleearth-middleware.herokuapp.com/api/posts/:id | GET, PUT, DELETE |

### Custom Middleware Functions

- `logger()`

  - `logger` logs to the console the following information about each request: request method, request url, and a timestamp
  - this middleware runs on every request made to the API

- `validateUserId()`

  - `validateUserId` validates the user id on every request that expects a user id parameter
  - if the `id` parameter is valid, store that user object as `req.user`
  - if the `id` parameter does not match any user id in the database, cancel the request and respond with status `400` and `{ message: "invalid user id" }`

- `validateUser()`

  - `validateUser` validates the `body` on a request to create a new user
  - if the request `body` is missing, cancel the request and respond with status `400` and `{ message: "missing user data" }`
  - if the request `body` is missing the required `name` field, cancel the request and respond with status `400` and `{ message: "missing required name field" }`

- `validatePost()`
  - `validatePost` validates the `body` on a request to create a new post
  - if the request `body` is missing, cancel the request and respond with status `400` and `{ message: "missing post data" }`
  - if the request `body` is missing the required `text` field, cancel the request and respond with status `400` and `{ message: "missing required text field" }`

### Database Persistence Helpers

There are two helper files that you can use to manage the persistence of _users_ and _posts_ data. These files are `users/userDb.js` and `posts/postDb.js`. Both files publish the following api:

- `get()`: calling find returns a promise that resolves to an array of all the `resources` contained in the database.
- `getById()`: takes an `id` as the argument and returns a promise that resolves to the `resource` with that id if found.
- `insert()`: calling insert passing it a `resource` object will add it to the database and return the new `resource`.
- `update()`: accepts two arguments, the first is the `id` of the `resource` to update and the second is an object with the `changes` to apply. It returns the count of updated records. If the count is 1 it means the record was updated correctly.
- `remove()`: the remove method accepts an `id` as it's first parameter and, upon successfully deleting the `resource` from the database, returns the number of records deleted.

The `userDb.js` helper includes an extra method called `getUserPosts()` that when passed a user's `id`, returns a list of all the `posts` for the `user`.

**All helper methods return a promise.**

#### Database Schemas

The _Database Schemas_ for the `users` and `posts` resources are:

##### Users

| field | data type        | metadata                                            |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id    | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| name  | string           | required, unique                                    |

##### Posts

| field   | data type        | metadata                                            |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id      | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| text    | text             | required                                            |
| user_id | unsigned integer | required, must be the `id` of an existing `user`    |
